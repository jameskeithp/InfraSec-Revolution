Infrastructure Security Upgrade Project

Project Overview

This project was initiated to enhance the security posture of our organization's IT infrastructure, focusing specifically on servers and networks. Given the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, our goal was to identify vulnerabilities within our current setup and implement robust security measures to mitigate potential risks. This README.md serves as a comprehensive guide to the project's objectives, phases, outcomes, and the lessons learned throughout the process.
